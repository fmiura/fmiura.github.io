Use this template to prepare for and document weekly PhD progress meetings.

---

### 1. Basic information

- _Date:_
- _Participants:_
- _Next meeting (tentative):_

---

### 2. Updates since last meeting

#### 2.1 Plan vs Done

- _Planned last week:_
  - e.g., Prepare preliminary regression results on vaccination uptake; read XXX et al. (2021).
- _What I actually did:_
  - e.g., Cleaned dataset (N = 2,025), produced first logistic regression; unexpected missingness in two variables.

#### 2.2 Findings / Progress

- _Key findings:_
  - e.g., Preliminary model suggests age and household size strongly predict vaccine uptake; missingness seems non-random.

---

### 3. Questions & Issues

- _What I need help with / unclear points:_
  - e.g., How to handle non-random missing data?
  - e.g., Should we include interaction between age and risk group?
  - e.g., Unsure whether to use mixed effects or fixed effects for location.

---

### 4. Goals before next meeting

- _Main tasks for the coming week:_
  - e.g., Run sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation; rerun model with interaction terms; draft 1–2 figures for the results section.

---

### 5. Meeting notes (filled during meeting)

#### 5.1 Key decisions

- e.g., Will use multiple imputation; interaction term to be included; focus on 18–45 age group for first manuscript draft.

#### 5.2 Action points (Who / What / When)

| Who        | What                                                      | By when        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Student    | Run imputation + updated model                            | Thursday 13:00 |
| Supervisor | Share literature on missing data strategies               | Tuesday 18:00  |
| Student    | Prepare draft figures (uptake by age, model coefficients) | Next meeting   |

---

### 6. Other points

- e.g., Consider contacting XXX for access to 2023 dataset; potential delay expected due to data request review.
- e.g., Check internal procedures for the payment of conference fee.
