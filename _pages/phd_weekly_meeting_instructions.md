### Proposed meeting structure

#### Before meetings

The student sends **(i) an agenda** and **(ii) related materials** to the project members (e.g., daily supervisor and/or collaborators) **one working day before** the meeting (e.g., by Friday end of day for the Monday meeting).

#### During meetings

The student leads the discussion based on the shared agenda. The student also documents all **action points** (who / when / what).

#### After meetings

Within the same day, the student sends the **updated meeting notes** to the daily supervisor and, if relevant, collaborators. The daily supervisor replies to confirm the notes. This ensures shared understanding of next steps and avoids miscommunication.

### Meeting duration

**Maximum 1 hour.**  
Focus on key issues and avoid unnecessary tangents.

### Additional remarks and tips

- It is completely fine if there are **no new results** — summarise what you explored or tried instead.
- Include agenda items together with their purpose (e.g., _discuss_, _decide_, _check-in only_).
- Be specific when describing tasks. For example:
  - “keep reading relevant literature” → “read XXX et al. (2020) and YYY et al. (2015) to draft the Introduction section.”
  - “check GAM” → “learn the concept using ZZZ.com and AAA textbook chapters 1–3, then test example R scripts.”
