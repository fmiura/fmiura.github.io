### Proposed meeting structure

#### Before meetings

The student sends **(i) an agenda** and **(ii) related materials** to the project members (e.g., daily supervisor and/or collaborators) **one working day before** the meeting (e.g., by Friday end of day for the Monday meeting).

#### During meetings

The student leads the discussion based on the shared agenda. The student also documents all **action points** (who / when / what).

#### After meetings

Within the same day, the student sends the **updated meeting notes** to the daily supervisor and, if relevant, collaborators. The daily supervisor replies to confirm the notes. This ensures shared understanding of next steps and avoids miscommunication.
