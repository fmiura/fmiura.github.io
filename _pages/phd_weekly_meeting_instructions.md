# PhD Weekly Meeting – General Instructions

*Last updated: 4 November 2025*

## Proposed meeting structure

### Before meetings
The student sends **(i) an agenda** and **(ii) related materials** to the project members (e.g., daily supervisor and/or collaborators) **one working day before** the meeting (e.g., by Friday end of day for the Monday meeting).

### During meetings
The student leads the discussion based on the shared agenda.  
The student also documents all **action points** (who / when / what).

### After meetings
Within the same day, the student sends the **updated meeting notes** to the daily supervisor and, if relevant, collaborators.  
The daily supervisor replies to confirm the notes.  
This ensures shared understanding of next steps and avoids miscommunication.

## Meeting Duration
**Maximum 1 hour.**  
Focus on key issues and avoid unnecessary tangents.
