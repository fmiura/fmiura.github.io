## Research Projects <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### Optimal control strategies

We develop and analyse control strategies for infectious diseases by combining theoretical and computational approaches.

- **Next-generation approach:** Applying matrix-based epidemic theory to identify optimal intervention targets.
- **Network models:** Capturing contact heterogeneity and structure in control design.
- **Control theory:** Exploring tools from dynamical systems to inform policy optimisation.

### Quantifying individual heterogeneity

Understanding how individuals vary in infection and transmission risk is key to targeted interventions.

- **Dose-response models and human challenge trials:** Investigating susceptibility and infectiousness variation.
- **Viral shedding dynamics and biomarkers:** Analysing intra-host processes to inform population-level modelling.

### Alternative data for epidemics

Expanding the evidence base for public health responses through novel data sources.

- **Wastewater data:** Integrating mechanistic models with community-level viral loads.
- **(Future)** **Socioeconomic signals:** Leveraging dynamic linear models and functional data analysis to capture behavioural and structural determinants of transmission.

### Outbreak analytics

Real-time data analysis and decision support during epidemics, informed by statistical and mechanistic tools.

### Conceptualising and operationalising infection control policy

Bridging the gap between theoretical models and actionable policy design.

- **(Future)** **Decision theory:** Formalising how interventions are chosen under uncertainty.
- **(Future)** **Causal inference:** Evaluating causal effects of preventive measures.
- **(Future)** **What is evidence?:** Rethinking "evidence" in the context of pandemic preparedness.
